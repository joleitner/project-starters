# My personal project templates

This repository contains a collection of project templates, which I like to use as a starting point.

In each subfolder, you will find a README.md file with instructions on how to use the template or how to modify it to fit your needs.

## Available templates

- [SvelteKit with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI](./sveltekit)
- [FastAPI with PostgreSQL and SQLModel](./fastapi)
- more to come...
